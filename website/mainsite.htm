    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>Biopharmaceuticals like antibodies and viral vectors are extremely potent medicals due to their
      high specificity and efficacy. While antibodies are already produced on a large scale, the
      production of novel viral therapeutics is more complicated. These viral vectors and vaccines
      require multiple post translational modifications which are not feasible in the current internal
      production platforms in the human pharma business unit of Boehringer Ingelheim. For these
      purposes, HEK293 cells will build the basis for a suitable platform. This cell line from human
      origin allows for production of these medicines. To create this platform, a thorough
      understanding of the process and cell metabolism is required. In this project, a model is created
      to describe and predict the behavior of HEK293 cells using Metabolic Flux Analyses. This model
      can also be used for optimizing media formulations, by identifying bottlenecks in the
      metabolism of the cells, thereby majorly increasing development speed and success. The model
      is tested and verified in a Design of Experiment setup using the ambr®15 bioreactor. Investigated
      factors are the seeding cell density, glucose limit, glutamine source, glutamine source
      concentration and tyrosine concentration of the growth medium. The seeding cell density was
      found to be highly important for controlling and shifting the metabolism of the cells into a
      stationary phase. The tyrosine and glutamine source concentrations were also relevant for more
      specific reactions as alanine transaminase. This model provides a basis for more in depth
      research on the differences between growth phases and eventually implementing virus
      production.</p>

      origin allows for production of these medicines. To create this platform, a thorough
      understanding of the process and cell metabolism is required. In this project, a model is created
      to describe and predict the behavior of HEK293 cells using Metabolic Flux Analyses. This model
      can also be used for optimizing media formulations, by identifying bottlenecks in the
      metabolism of the cells, thereby majorly increasing development speed and success. The model
      is tested and verified in a Design of Experiment setup using the ambr®15 bioreactor. Investigated
      factors are the seeding cell density, glucose limit, glutamine source, glutamine source
      concentration and tyrosine concentration of the growth medium. The seeding cell density was
      found to be highly important for controlling and shifting the metabolism of the cells into a
      stationary phase. The tyrosine and glutamine source concentrations were also relevant for more
      specific reactions as alanine transaminase. This model provides a basis for more in depth
      research on the differences between growth phases and eventually implementing virus
      production.</p>
